# Bitcoin-Events.com

A map and list of Bitcoin-related notable events and conferences.

In order to keep the map readable, regular meetups are not included. If you want to see local Bitcoin communities, you can have a look at [BTC Map - Communities](https://btcmap.org/communities).

I'm limiting myself to European events for now. Also, events in France (and neighboring countries) may be more up to date than in the rest of Europe. Feel free to submit events and to update the map! Instructions on how to do it will be provided soon:tm:.

## This repository

For now, this repo contains an ansible playbook that deploys the web server, the (one-pager) website, and the tile server for the map.

**/!&#92; Ongoing development. Things may very well be a bit broken. /!&#92;**
